 <h3>By the Numbers: Verve Bowls Summer 2020</h3>
<b>Purpose</b>
The purpose of creating this infographic (below) is to help decision-makers at Verve Bowls make informed choices about team member training,
menu items and prices, and guest-offers. The goal for this project is to create an image which highlights important information in a readable, accesible and organized manner.
<b>Process</b>
 In order to create the image shown below, I began by downloading a CSV file which was created from our point of sales system, Square. I then cleaned and parsed the file for relvent data, transforming that data into digestable information in the forms of graphs, paragraphs and other imagery. I chose a simple color palette and sans-serif fonts to make the image readable and neat.
